# Sprint Challenge: Processes and Scheduling

## Multiple Choice and Short Answer Questions

Add your answers inline, below, with your pull request.

1. List all of the main states a process may be in at any point in time on a standard Unix system. Briefly explain what each of these states mean.
CREATED - ready to be added by the scheduler
READY - waiting, loaded up, awaiting execution in the queue
RUNNING - currently being executed by the CPU in either Kernel or User mode
BLOCKED - can't continue without some other process/event doing something
TERMINATED - no longer running, but exists until parent process reads the exit status

2. What is a Zombie Process? How does it get created? How does it get destroyed?
A zombie process has been terminated (either naturally or by another process), but it hangs around in the system until its parent process reads its exit status. If the parent process never calls wait(), this can cause a resource leak.

3. Describe the job of the Scheduler in the OS in general.
To allocate the system's processing resources in an effective way. The Scheduler cycles through various processes based on their status, giving the CPU power over to them for a short time before moving to the next process.

4. Describe the benefits of the MLFQ over a plain Round-Robin scheduler.
MLFQ is a more intricate algorithm for determining how processes should get CPU time. It ensures that short, high-priority tasks get completed first. It allocates time and re-queues processes dynamically to make the system more effieicnt overall.

## Programming Exercise: The Lambda School Shell (`lssh`)

This program implements a new shell that you can use to run commands from in
Unix, similar to bash!

At the end of the day, you should be able to run your shell, the run commands within it like so:

```
[bash]$ ./lssh 
lambda-shell$ ls -l
total 32
-rwxr-xr-x  1 beej  staff  9108 Mar 15 13:28 lssh
-rw-r--r--  1 beej  staff  2772 Mar 15 13:27 lssh.c
lambda-shell$ head lssh.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>

#define PROMPT "lambda-shell$ "

#define MAX_TOKENS 100
#define COMMANDLINE_BUFSIZE 1024
#define DEBUG 0  // Set to 1 to turn on some debugging output
lambda-shell$ exit
[bash]$ 
```

General attack is to:

* Loop until the user exits.
  * Print a prompt.
  * Read a line of input from the keyboard.
  * Parse that line down into individual space-separated parts of the command.
  * Fork a child process to run the new command.
  * Exec the command in the child process.
  * Parent process waits for child to complete.

Some of the shell is already written, but you have to write the guts of it.

Examine the `lssh.c` file and:

* Determine which parts of the program do what.
* Read the header comments.
* Find the parts you need to implement.
* Come up with an individual plan of attack for each of those parts.
* Determine how to exit the shell.
* What happens if you build it?
* What happens if you run it?

Resist the urge to start coding until you've done all that and read this
complete challenge.

Hint: you probably want one of the `exec` variants that has the `p` suffix on it
so that the `PATH` will be searched for the file you're trying to run. Choose
your `exec` variant carefully. Some will be hard-to-impossible to use. Some will
be easy.

When you get this working, _you will have your own shell_. It's not as
full-featured as bash, by any means, but it is a legitimate shell and the core
is the same as any other shell.

If you finish early, look at extra credit to start implementing more features.

### Extra Credit: Change Directories with `cd`

In bash, you can change directories with the built-in `cd` command.

Each process keep track of which directory it is running in, and the shell is no
exception. Each process can change its current directory, as well.

> Why is `cd` built into the shell? Why can't it run as an external command?

Because it is built in, you should check to see if the user entered `cd` in
`args[0]` _before_ running the command. And if they did, you should
short-circuit the rest of the main loop with a `continue` statement.

> Look at the implementation of the built-in `exit` command for inspiration.

You can use the program `pwd` to see what directory you are in.

Example run:

```
lambda-shell$ pwd
/Users/example
lambda-shell$ cd src
lambda-shell$ pwd
/Users/example/src
lambda-shell$ cd ..
lambda-shell$ pwd
/Users/example
lambda-shell$ cd foobar
chdir: No such file or directory
lambda-shell$ 
```

If the user entered `cd` as the first argument:

1. Check to make sure they've entered 2 total arguments
2. Run the system call `chdir()` on the second argument to change directories
3. Error check the result of `chdir()`. If it returns `-1`, meaning an error
   occurred, you can print out an error message with:
   ```
   perror("chdir"); // #include <errno.h> to use this
   ```
4. Execute a `continue` statement to short-circuit the rest of the main loop.

Note that `.` and `..` are actual directories. You don't need to write any
special case code to handle them.

### Extra Credit: Background Tasks

In bash, you can run a program in the background by adding an `&` after the
command.

```
ls -la &
```

Add similar functionality to `lssh` by checking to see if the last argument is
an `&`.

If it is:

1. Strip the `&` off the `args` (by setting that pointer to `NULL`).
2. Run the command in the child as usual.
3. Prevent the parent from `wait()`ing for the child to complete. Just give a
   new prompt immediately. The child will continue to run in the background.

Note that you might get weird output when doing this, like the prompt might
appear before the program completes, or not at all if the program's output
overwrites it. If it looks like it hangs at the end, just hit `RETURN` to get
another prompt back.


### Extra Credit: File Redirection

In bash, you can redirect the output of a program into a file with `>`. This
creates a new file and puts the output of the command in there instead of
writing it to the screen.

```
ls -l > foo.txt
```

Check the `args` array for a `>`. If it's there:

1. Get the output file name from the next element in `args`.
2. Strip everything out of `args` from the `>` on. (Set the `args` element with
   the `>` in it to `NULL`).
3. In the child process:
    1. `open()` the file for output. Store the resultant file descriptor in a
       variable `fd`.
    2. Use the `dup2()` system call to make `stdout` (file descriptor `1`) refer
       to the newly-opened file instead:

	    ```c
		int fd = open(...
		dup2(fd, 1);  // Now stdout goes to the file instead
		```
	3. `exec` the program like normal.

### Extra Credit: Pipes

In bash, you can pipe the output of one command into the input of another with
the `|` symbol.

For example, this takes the output of `ls -l` and uses it as the input for `wc
-l` (which counts the number of lines in the input):

```
ls -l | wc -l
```

This uses the `pipe()` system call.

Use a process similar to the above extra credit challenges, along with [this
description of how to implement pipes in
C](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki/How-Unix-Pipes-are-Implemented)
to get pipes implemented in `lssh`.
